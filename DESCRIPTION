Description: Landscape genetics is a mix of population genetic routines based in a spatially
    explicit framework as is encountered in many landscape ecology projects.  That said, it is
    a bit deviant from straight-up landscape ecology and this is where the routines in this 
    package come in, leveraging spatial data in a way that fits into population genetic analyses.
    This package is intended to be used in conjunction with gstudio and popgraph as part of a larger
    suite of analysis routines.
